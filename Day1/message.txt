1️⃣ Head Section:
- Learned essential <head> elements:
    • <title> for page title

    • <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> for responsive design
    • <meta name="description"> & <meta name="keywords"> for SEO
    • <link rel="stylesheet"> to attach CSS
    • <link rel="icon"> for page icon

2️⃣ Body Section:
- Structure: <header>, <main>, <footer>
- Header & Navigation:
    • <nav> element for navigation
    • Using <ul> and <li> for menu items (real-life dev approach)
    • <a href="#"> links inside <li>

    • <main> as hero section
    • <section> elements for content areas
- Footer:
    • Simple <footer> with copyright

3️⃣ Forms:
- <form> with method and action attributes
- <input> types: text, password, file
- <label> with "for" attribute linked to input id (focus on click)
- 'name' attribute sends data to backend as key
- 'required' and 'placeholder' attributes
- File uploads:
    • enctype="multipart/form-data" needed
    • Backend receives via file:UploadFile=File(...) in FastAPI

4️⃣ Inline content with <span>:
- Use <span> to style specific words inline
- Can assign id to modify via JS later
- Example: <p>This is a <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">special</span> word!</p>
