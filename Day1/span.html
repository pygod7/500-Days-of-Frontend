style is nothng but just a container for inline elements where we can add CSS on.

<p>This is a <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">special</span> word!</p>

also supports ID for some inline stuff. like:

<p> My name is <span id="name"> Rubin </span> </span></p> so this name can be later modified using JS
